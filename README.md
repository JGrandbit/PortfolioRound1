# PortfolioRound1

First attempt at a portfolio

In this project I attempted to use the Bootstrap method. 

Bootstrap might have been a poor choice, as I didn't fully understand it. 

Couldn't figure out how to get my buttons/navigation bar to work properly. 

I did sucessfully add an image with alt 

Div classes were looking great until I failed at CSS. 

There might be too much going on in the header. My style sheet did not link. 

An overall work in progress.
